# MyProjects 
 1. EasterEggs.java : If you know the total number of eggs hidden and amount in both of the baskets (You and your friend). Evaluate if it is time to eat candy or keep hunting for more eggs.
 2. GuardFlamingo : Given the length and the width of a rectangular yard, we have to determine how many flamingos we should buy to put one every 2 feet along the edges of the yard.
 3. Izzy the Iguana : Your pet Iguana has run away, and you found it up in a tree! It will come down right away if you brought the right snacks, but if you don't have enough, you will have to wait. You nedd 10 total snack points to bring it down. Lettuce is worth 5, Carrot worth 4, Mongo worth 9, and Cheeseburger is worth 0. We have to evaluate whether or not we have enough snack points to convince the iguana to come down.
 4. NumberOfOnes : Count the number of ones in the binary representation of a given integer
 5. Multiples : You need to calculate the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below a given number. Given an integer number, output the sum of all the multiples of 3 and 5 below that number. If a number is a multiple of both 3 and 5, it should appear in the sum only once.
